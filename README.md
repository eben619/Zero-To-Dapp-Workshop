## <div align="center"> Resource Materials </div>

Celo Composer allows you to quickly build, deploy, and iterate on decentralized applications using Celo. It provides a number of frameworks, examples, and Celo specific functionality to help you get started with your next dApp.

## Prerequisites

- Node (v20 or higher)
- Git (v2.38 or higher)

<details>
  <summary>HOW TO USE CELO COMPOSER</summary><br>

  The easiest way to start with Celo Composer is by using `@celo/celo-composer`. This CLI tool lets you quickly start building dApps on Celo for multiple frameworks, including React (with either react-celo or rainbowkit-celo), React Native (w/o Expo), Flutter, and Angular. To get started, just run the following command, and follow the steps:

- Step 1

```bash
npx @celo/celo-composer@latest create
```

- Step 2: Provide the Project Name: You will be prompted to enter the name of your project.

```text
What is your project name: 
```

- Step 3: Choose to Use Hardhat: You will be asked if you want to use Hardhat. Select Yes or No.

```text
Do you want to use Hardhat? (Y/n)
```

- Step 4: Choose to Use a Template: You will be asked if you want to use a template. Select `Yes` or `No`.

```text
Do you want to use a template?
```

- Step 5: Select a Template: If you chose to use a template, you will be prompted to select a template from the list provided.

```text
- Minipay
- Valora
- Social Connect
```

- Step 6: Provide the Project Owner's Name: You will be asked to enter the project owner's name.

```text
Project Owner name:
```

- Step 7: Wait for Project Creation: The CLI will now create the project based on your inputs. This may take a few minutes.

- Step 8: Follow the instructions to start the project. The same will be displayed on the console after the project is created.

```text
ðŸš€ Your starter project has been successfully created!

Before you start the project, please follow these steps:

1. Rename the file:
   packages/react-app/.env.template
   to
   packages/react-app/.env

2. Open the newly renamed .env file and add all the required environment variables.

Once you've done that, you're all set to start your project!

Run the following commands from the packages/react-app folder to start the project:

   yarn install
   yarn react-app:dev
```

  <summary>
SYNTAX EXPLANATION
  </summary><br>

  ***SUMMARY***

  This contract effectively implements a basic escrow mechanism with three main participants: the buyer, the seller, and the escrow agent. It uses the State enum to track the progress of the transaction and various modifiers to enforce rules about who can call certain functions and when. The contract ensures that funds are securely held and only released based on specific actions by the buyer or the escrow agent, thereby providing a secure method for handling transactions that require an escrow.<br>


  ***License Identifier:***  The line // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT specifies that this contract is licensed under the MIT license, which is a permissive free software license.


***Pragma Directive:*** pragma solidity ^0.8.0; declares that the contract is written for Solidity version 0.8.0 or higher, but not including version 0.9.0.


***Contract Declaration:***
    contract Escrow defines a new smart contract named Escrow.
    

***Enum State***

    `enum State { AWAITING_PAYMENT, AWAITING_DELIVERY, COMPLETE, REFUNDED } defines a custom type with four possible values: AWAITING_PAYMENT,           AWAITING_DELIVERY, COMPLETE, and REFUNDED. This enum helps manage the different stages of the escrow process.`
    

***State Variables***

        address public buyer;: This is a public state variable that holds the Ethereum address of the buyer.

        address payable public seller;: This is a public state variable that holds the Ethereum address of the seller, marked as payable because it will receive Ether.

        address public escrowAgent;: This is a public state variable that holds the Ethereum address of the escrow agent, who acts as a trusted third party.

        State public currentState;: This is a public state variable of type State that holds the current state of the escrow transaction.
        


***Constructor:*** The constructor is a special function that is executed only once when the contract is deployed. It initializes the contract with specific values:

        buyer = _buyer;: Sets the buyer's address to the value provided in _buyer parameter.

        seller = _seller;: Sets the seller's payable address to the value provided in _seller parameter.

        escrowAgent = msg.sender;: Assigns the deployer of the contract as the escrow agent.

        currentState = State.AWAITING_PAYMENT;  Sets the initial state of the escrow to AWAITING_PAYMENT, indicating that the contract is waiting for the buyer to deposit funds.
        

***Modifiers***

    onlyBuyer: This modifier restricts access to a function, ensuring that only the buyer can call it. It checks if msg.sender (the address that called the function) is equal to the buyer's address.

    onlyEscrowAgent: This modifier restricts access to a function, ensuring that only the escrow agent can call it. It checks if msg.sender is equal to the escrow agent's address.

    inState: This modifier restricts function execution based on the current state of the contract. It ensures that the contract is in the specified expectedState before allowing the function to run.
    
        
***Deposit Function:***  This function allows the buyer to deposit Ether into the escrow contract.

    external: Specifies that this function can be called from outside the contract.

    payable: Indicates that the function can receive Ether.

    onlyBuyer: Ensures that only the buyer can call this function.

    inState(State.AWAITING_PAYMENT): Ensures that the contract is currently in the AWAITING_PAYMENT state.

    require(msg.value > 0, "Deposit must be greater than 0.");: This check ensures that the deposited amount is greater than zero.

    currentState = State.AWAITING_DELIVERY;: After a successful deposit, the contract state is updated to AWAITING_DELIVERY.

***confirmDelivery Function:***  This function allows the buyer to confirm the delivery of goods or services, which releases the escrowed funds to the seller.

    external: Specifies that this function can be called from outside the contract.

    onlyBuyer: Ensures that only the buyer can call this function.

    inState(State.AWAITING_DELIVERY): Ensures that the contract is currently in the AWAITING_DELIVERY state.

    currentState = State.COMPLETE;: Updates the contract state to COMPLETE.

    seller.transfer(address(this).balance);: Transfers all Ether held in the contract to the seller.


***refund Function:***  This function allows the escrow agent to refund the buyer if the delivery conditions are not met.

    external: Specifies that this function can be called from outside the contract.

    onlyEscrowAgent: Ensures that only the escrow agent can call this function.

    inState(State.AWAITING_DELIVERY): Ensures that the contract is currently in the AWAITING_DELIVERY state.

    currentState = State.REFUNDED;: Updates the contract state to REFUNDED.

    payable(buyer).transfer(address(this).balance);: Transfers all Ether held in the contract back to the buyer.
